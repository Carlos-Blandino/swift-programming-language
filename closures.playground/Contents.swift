//:# Closures

/*:
 Closures are self-contained blocks of code that can be shared through out your code
 and have access to the variables  from its parent closure
 
 Global functions are closures that have a name and do not capture any values.
 Nested functions are closures that have a name and can capture values from their enclosing function.
 Closure expressions are unnamed closures written in a lightweight syntax that can capture values from their surrounding context.

//:### Closure Expression Syntax
//parameters can not have default values
//variadic, inout, and tuples are okay
/*:
 { (parameters) -> return type in
     statements
 }
 */

//:### Inferring Type From Context

//:### Implicit Returns from Single-Expression Closures
//single-expression closures can omit the return keyword
var reversedNames = names.sorted(by: { s1, s2 in s1 > s2 } )

//:### Shorthand Argument Names

//swift automatically provides shorthand argument names to inline closures

//:## Trailing Closures

// Here's how you call this function without using a trailing closure:

someFunctionThatTakesAClosure(closure: {
    // closure's body goes here
})

// Here's how you call this function with a trailing closure instead:

someFunctionThatTakesAClosure() {
    // trailing closure's body goes here
}
reversedNames = names.sorted() { $0 > $1 }
//if a closure expression is provided as the only argument and you use it as trailing closure then you don't need the parentheses

        runningTotal += amount
        return runningTotal
    }
    return incrementer
}
/*:
 A nested function can capture any of its outer function’s arguments and can also capture any constants and variables defined within the outer function.
 
 It does this by capturing a reference to runningTotal and amount from the surrounding function and using them within its own function body. Capturing by reference ensures that runningTotal and amount do not disappear when the call to makeIncrementer ends, and also ensures that runningTotal is available the next time the incrementer function is called.

//:## Escaping Closures

/*:
 A closure is said to escape a function when the closure is passed as an argument
 to the function, but is called after the function returns. Need to write @escaping before
 the prameter type
 
 used in comletion handler
 
 its executed in the future, outliving the function that it was created in
 
 used in  asynchronous programming

//:## Autoclosures

/*:
 An autoclosure is a closure that is automatically created to wrap an expression that’s being passed as an argument to a function. It doesn’t take any arguments, and when it’s called, it returns the value of the expression that’s wrapped inside of it. This syntactic convenience lets you omit braces around a function’s parameter by writing a normal expression instead of an explicit closure.
