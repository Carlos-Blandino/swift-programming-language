//Swifts native String type is built from Unicode scalar values and

//:### Extended Grapheme Clusters

//this set the stage for why we index a string with String.index type rather than
//an Integer

//each Character type represents a single "extended grapheme cluster" which in certain
//instances the characters can be combined, forming a single human-readable character
//and count as one - many combined memory spaces will be represented by the String.index representaion

//:## Accessing and Modifying a String

//:### String Indices

//because of the possibility of combined cluster(memory requirements can differ), strings are
//not indexed by an integer but rather the type is a String.index
//for each position of each character in the string

//you must iterate over each Unicode scalar from the .startIndex or .endIndex of the
//string,

//startIndex and endIndex are equal when the string is empty
